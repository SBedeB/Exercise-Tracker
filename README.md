# Exercise-Tracker
The Exercise Tracker project is a full-stack JavaScript application designed to manage exercise data for multiple users. The project involves building RESTful API endpoints for user creation, exercise logging, and exercise log retrieval. Users can be created, and their exercise activities can be logged with details such as description, duration, and date. The application also supports retrieving exercise logs for a specific user, including optional date range filtering and log entry limit. The project incorporates MongoDB as the database for storing user and exercise data, and it utilizes Express.js to create the server and handle HTTP requests. The user interface is minimal, primarily focusing on API functionality and data management. The project aims to demonstrate proficiency in building server-side applications, handling database interactions, and implementing RESTful API endpoints.
